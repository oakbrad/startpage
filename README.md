# Start Page

A simple CSS site that shows my common links, the date / time, and a RSS feed (I use https://rssmix.com to combined several social feeds).

## Using it Yourself

* Install pywal and generate a color scheme. https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki
* Update main.css to import the correct path for your cached scheme (/home/whatever/.cache/wal/colors.css probably)
* Edit main.js with the URL to a valid RSS feed

## Other Projects Used

* rss-parser - https://github.com/bobby-brennan/rss-parser
